# PyBer Ride Sharing Analysis

## Overview of Project
   The purpose of this project is to provide the company PyBer with visual representations of the data collected from the PyBer ridesharing app. The reason for this project is to provide useful information to aid decision makers at PyBer. The data is analyzed by three different city types urban, suburban, and rural. For example, the data below represents useful information for PyBer such as the average fare per ride and the average fare per driver, based on the city types.

## Results
	The city type with the lowest average fare per ride and highest total fare amount is the urban city type. Urban city types also have the highest amount of drivers with a total of 2,405 drivers. Urban cities are a great fit for the PyBer ride-sharing app because places tend to be closer together, there are plenty of drivers available and the the prices are reasonable.
