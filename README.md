# PyBer Ride Sharing Analysis

## Overview of Project
The purpose of this project is to provide the company PyBer with visual representations of the data collected from the PyBer ridesharing app. The reason for this project is to provide useful information to aid decision makers at PyBer. The data is analyzed by three different city types urban, suburban, and rural. For example, the data below represents useful information for PyBer such as the average fare per ride and the average fare per driver, based on the city types.

The city type with the lowest average fare per ride and highest total fare amount is the urban city type. Urban city types also have the highest number of drivers with a total of 2,405 drivers. Urban cities are a great fit for the PyBer ride-sharing app because places tend to be closer together, there are plenty of drivers available and the prices are reasonable. 


The total amount of drivers for the suburban city type is 490, significantly less in comparison to the urban city type. The average fare per ride in a suburban city had a 6-dollar increase compared to the average fare in an urban city. The reason for this increase is because places in suburban cities are slightly further away from each other making the commute longer which increases the fare. The PyBer app in suburban city types are less accessible and slightly more expensive. This could cause customers to use a different app. 


Rural city types have the highest average fare per ride with a total average fare of $34.62. The reason the average fare is higher than the previous city types is due to the lack of drivers for rural cities. The total number of drivers for rural city types is 78. The PyBer app could be useful for people in rural cities however, the expensive fare prices and the small number of drivers are not appealing to prospective customers.
	
## Summary

In conclusion, urban city types are the most ideal city types for the PyBer ridesharing app. Based on the data above, I recommend that PyBer hire more drivers for suburban and rural city types to provide more access for customers. Increasing the number of drivers will also reduce the fare and make PyBer more appealing. I also recommend incorporating a point rewards system where you can accumulate points to get a set amount of money taken off the fare. This rewards system could encourage the customer to continue using PyBer in order to receive the reward. My last recommendation is to give every first-time rider a free ride or a discounted ride to increase the users and popularity of the app.
